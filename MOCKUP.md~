## Differences in Mockup Compared to Actual 

We think the design is going to differ from the mockup in the following ways:
   -Start state will not have all of the components due to not knowing how to fully
   do all the code to make it happen.
   -The bricks will not all be different colors becuase we are using the color of the brick
   to represent the health of the brick and not a different way to show the deteriotion of health
   as the game progresses.
   
The primary reason for any differences appearing between the mockup and actual design will primarily
be caused by our ability to code in what we wanted to. This is our first time coding a game in javafx
and we do not fully know its syntax or tricks in coding games or animations. The actual game will most 
likely be a very simple version of the brick breakout game, but it will still have the full functionality
of the game.
